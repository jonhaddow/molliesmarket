This recipe is super easy and takes less than 5 minutes to make. Its great when added to pasta, sandwiches, and salads, and even spread over puff pastry with cream cheese, and rolled and sliced into pinwheels. These are especially great for weaning babies, as they are really easy to eat and are low in salt.

This pesto can be used to make a cheap, easy, mid-week vegan meal the whole family can eat when added to pasta alone. Our one year old baby loves this, and its easy for him to feed himself.

Hereâ€™s the recipe:

## Ingredients

-   60g Cashew nuts
-   140g Spinach
-   1 Garlic clove
-   5 tbsp Olive oil
-   2 tbsp Lemon juice
-   Salt and pepper to taste (leave salt out if serving to babies)

## Method

-   Simply add all the ingredients to a food processor and blend!

This pesto can be covered and stored in the fridge. Old jam jars are great for storage. It should last longer than shop bought varieties of pesto, especially if a layer of olive oil is added to the top!

I hope you enjoy!
