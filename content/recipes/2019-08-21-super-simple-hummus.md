This is another super simple recipe that takes under ten minutes to make. This hummus is great in a roll with a veggie burger or falafel, or in a wrap with salad and cheese. Or simply with raw veggie sticks for a healthy snack. I hope you enjoy it!

## Ingredients

-   1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
-   1 tbsp lemon juice
-   2 tbsp tahini
-   4-5 tbsp olive oil (start with 4, and add more in necessary)
-   2 garlic cloves, crushed
-   Salt to taste

You can also add 1 teaspoon of cumin and Â½ a teaspoon of chilli powder if you like a spicier hummus. This goes well with falafel or veggie burgers.

## Method

1.  Add all the ingredients to a food processor or blender, and whizz until smooth. You may need to stir the hummus between blending, to ensure it is well mixed and smooth.

Store the hummus in the fridge, with a layer of olive oil on top, to keep it fresh for longer.
